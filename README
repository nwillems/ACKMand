ACKMand is a fictional character - so far he doesn't do much, and his universe
is pretty much limited to this weird place, where you can get coffee and
interact with computers

Small stories, will eventually come.

One day ACKMand met a strange guy, he had kind of a long hair. He wore glasses and a woolen shirt. 
His name was CurlGuy. In the long run he became part of the CS:Heroes, as an honest acoomplish to ACKMand.
